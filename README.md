 Circumventing the Disteance Concentration Phenomena
 
Description. Several strategies can be developed to deal with distance concentration phenomena. One of
them, seen in class, consists in using suitable norms, and to project to lower dimensional spaces. Another one,
proposed in [CTP11], consists in using a biasing potential which aims at focusing on the most informative
distances only. In this project, we aim at applying the procedure from [CTP11] to a dierent molecular data
set, namely an ensemble of conformations of a protein model known as BLN69 [RDRC16]. In a nutshell,
BLN69 is a linear chain of 69 beads; since each bead has 3 cartesian coordinates, a conformation is dened
by a point in dimension d = 369 = 207. To each conformation, one can also associate an energy, which will
be given along with the conformations. Finally, to measure the distance between two conformations, we shall
use the least root mean square deviation http://sbl.inria.fr/doc/Molecular_distances-user-manual.
